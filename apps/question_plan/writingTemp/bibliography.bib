abstract = {A naturalized model of rationality is developed, with a focus on an important but largely neglected aspect: knowledge of error, or “negative” knowledge. The development of knowledge of what counts as error occurs via a kind of internal variation and selection, or quasi-evolutionary, process. Processes of reflection generate a hierarchy of principles of error, a hierarchy that frames and constrains positive rationality. The dynamics of rationality is an internalization of processes of reflected-upon variation and selection. The nature and origin of logic are addressed from within this framework, and the overall rationality model is applied to three central issues in the philosophy of science: the rational function of truth and realism in science, the nature of progress in science, and the rationality of certain induction-like considerations.}}

author = {Herbert H. Clark},
abstract = {Indirect speech acts, like the request Do you know the time?, have both a literal meaning, here “I ask you whether you know the time,” and an indirect meaning “I request you to tell me the time.” In this paper I outline a model of how listeners understand such speech acts and plan responses to them. The main proposals are these. The literal meaning of indirect speech acts can be intended to be taken seriously (along with the indirect meaning) or merely pro forma. In the first case listeners are expected to respond to both meanings, as in Yes, I do—it's six, but in the second case only to the indirect meaning, as in It's six. There are at least six sources of information listeners use in judging whether the literal meaning was intended seriously or pro forma, as well as whether there was intended to be any indirect meaning. These proposals were supported in five experiments in which ordinary requests for information were made by telephone of 950 local merchants.}}
